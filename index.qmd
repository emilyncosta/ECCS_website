## Bio

Hi, I’m Emilyn Costa Conceição Sharma — a biologist by training 🧬, a microbiologist by passion 🔬, and someone who spends a suspicious amount of time thinking about bacteria most people can’t even pronounce 😄.

I graduated in Biological Sciences from the Federal University of Pará (UFPA) in 2010 🎓, earned my master’s in Parasitic Biology in the Amazon from the State University of Pará (UEPA) in 2012 🦠, and completed my PhD in Microbiology at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) in 2018 📘. I also had the chance to spend an exciting year as a visiting PhD student at Université Paris Sud (2015–2016) — oui, baguettes and bacteria 🥖🇫🇷!

After that, I did a postdoc in Clinical Research on Infectious Diseases at the Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases, part of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (INI/Fiocruz), from 2020 to 2021 🧪. Since 2021, I’ve been based in South Africa 🇿🇦, working as a postdoctoral fellow in the Division of Molecular Biology and Human Genetics at Stellenbosch University.

My research is rooted in both basic and applied sciences 🔍, with a special focus on medical and environmental microbiology. I have a particular fascination for the Mycobacteria world — which includes Mycobacterium tuberculosis (a-ha! The TB villain 😷), Non-Tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM), and Mycobacterium leprae (yes, the one behind Hansen Disease).


## Key research interests

Here’s what I’m most into:

* **🧫 Exploring the diversity of Mycobacterium species** through a One Health lens, identifying them in animals, the environment, and clinical samples — part detective work, part microbial safari 🐾🌱.

* **🧬 Using molecular epidemiology tools** like spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR to understand how TB and leprosy spread.

* **📊 Studying TB transmission** with a precision health twist, powered by whole genome sequencing (WGS) — it’s like giving TB a DNA test and tracking its every move.

* **💊 Investigating how mycobacteria develop resistance to antibiotics**, and comparing what we see in the lab (phenotype) with what’s in their DNA (genotype).

* **⚡ Evaluating high-performance, rapid diagnostic tests for TB** including some that work directly from patient samples and are compatible with next-gen sequencing (NGS).

* **💻 Developing GEMIBRA**:, the Brazilian Mycobacterial Genome Platform, to support national disease surveillance.

* **🧠 Promoting science and health education** by creating educational tools and community engagement strategies — because science should never stay locked in the lab.


## Teaching

Teaching-wise, I also gained experience in higher education between 2012 and 2014 as a lecturer at UFPA and UEPA 🏫, including through Brazil’s national teacher training program (PARFOR/CAPES) 📚.

## Clinical trials

On the clinical side, from 2019 to 2021 I worked in the Bacteriology and Bioassay Lab at INI/Fiocruz 🧫, part of the city’s TB reference lab, contributing to research for the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) and TB-Alliance as a scientist in diagnostics and clinical research 🧍‍🔬.

In 2021, I took the lead on the SMARTT study (Sequencing Mycobacteria and Algorithm-Determined Resistant Tuberculosis Treatment) 🧪, and now I coordinate a sub-study in South Africa focused on applying WGS for managing drug-resistant TB — it’s called PARR-TB, part of the broader GenPath Africa project 🌍 on pathogen genomics for public health.

## Research in Brazil

Back in Brazil 🇧🇷, I co-coordinate the TB Surveillance Network for Northern and Northeastern Brazil (REVIGET N/NE), in collaboration with the Evandro Chagas Institute (IEC), where I’m mainly involved in lab training for WGS workflows, data analysis, and making sure no mycobacterial genome goes unexamined 🔍🧬.

I’m also a proud member of the "Geoprocessing, Health and Environment" research group at IEC 🛰️ — because understanding where diseases happen is just as important as knowing why.
