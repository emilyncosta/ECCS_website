<section id="what-is-ignite" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-ignite"><span style="color: #856A00;">What is IGNITE?</span></h2>
<p>The word “ignite”, according to the dictionary, means “to catch fire or cause to catch fire,” or “to arouse or inflame an emotion or situation.” Metaphorically, ignite signifies sparking passion, inspiration, or a surge of intense activity or emotion. It can describe awakening enthusiasm, lighting a fire within oneself, or triggering a powerful or transformative change.</p>
<p>That’s how the idea for <strong><span style="color: #856A00;">IGNITE?</span></strong> was conceived, and here it stands for <strong><span style="color: #ec3a8b;"> Inspiring Girls through Networking, Innovation, and Technical Excellence</span></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>IGNITE</strong> It’s a supportive, mid-term mentorship program designed to empower the next generation of women in science.</p>
</section>
<section id="who-is-involved" class="level2">

<p>Dr.&nbsp;Emilyn Costa Conceição Sharma 👩‍🔬 🇧🇷 earned her doctorate in Brazil during a period of significant political instability and underinvestment in science, immediately following the completion of her degree. Despite Brazil’s full support for her education, a shift in government political party - <a href="https://www.brasildefato.com.br/2021/04/16/five-years-after-the-coup-against-dilma-in-brazil-historians-take-stock/"><em>click here to know more</em></a> - led to instability and contributed to the subsequent diaspora of highly qualified individuals from the country.</p>
<p>Facing a lack of postdoctoral opportunities and no previous experience in industry, she found herself compelled to remove her academic titles—“Dr.” and “MSc” (masters)—from her CV in order to apply for positions in the private sector. One such opportunity was a role in the administration of a health facility 🏥, where the offered salary matched Brazil’s minimum wage—an amount attainable with only the high school certificate.</p>
<p>In an unexpected turn, while supporting a fellow PhD colleague in a similar situation, Dr.&nbsp;Emilyn Costa was invited to join a diagnostic bacteriology laboratory (Labbact) at INI/FIOCRUZ as a laboratory technologist (a role equivalent to that of a research assistant). This opportunity marked not only her return to scientific work but also the beginning of her first postdoctoral research internship. 🔬</p>
<p>Her hands-on experience in clinical research and TB diagnostics led to an offer to undertake a postdoctoral research project in Belgium 🇧🇪. At that time, she had to choose between continuing research in Europe 🌍 or coordinating laboratory activities for a clinical trial on TB genomics in South Africa 🇿🇦—a topic that deeply aligned with her research interests. She chose South Africa, motivated by a commitment to addressing a disease that disproportionately affects countries of the Global South, such as Brazil and South Africa. The position promised not only scientific growth 🌱 but also the chance to engage in meaningful knowledge exchange.</p>
<p>While in South Africa, she was encouraged to apply for independent research funding. However, this proved particularly difficult. The short-term nature of postdoctoral contracts, the lack of dedicated time for grant writing ✍️, and her ineligibility due to nationality or residency criteria severely limited her access to funding opportunities. Officially a resident of Brazil and living temporarily in South Africa, she did not meet the criteria required by either country’s funding bodies. 😔</p>
<p>Over time, she discovered that she fell into a professional gap. No longer considered an early-career researcher (due to exceeding the typical three-year post-PhD window), and without having led her own independent research as principal investigator (PI), she was also not recognized as mid-career. This left her in a “gravity-free” professional space—without firm ground to establish herself and grow in the way she aspired. 🚀</p>
<p>Despite these obstacles, Dr.&nbsp;Costa Conceição gained valuable skills throughout her international journey. From her doctoral studies in Europe, her diagnostic and clinical research work in Brazil, to her postdoctoral research in South Africa, she developed strong capabilities in self-management, scientific communication, quality control, strategic and critical thinking, mentorship, leadership, and time management. Most importantly, she came to understand the transformative power of scientific communities. 🤝</p>
<p>A firm believer in the collective power of shared knowledge, Emilyn has turned her own experiences into a structured curriculum aimed at empowering girls and women. Her goal is to expand opportunities beyond those defined by formal education systems, enabling women to choose their professional paths rather than being passively chosen—or excluded—by systemic failures. Through mentorship, she hopes to reduce the number of women who abandon careers in STEM fields due to a lack of decent work opportunities. 👩‍🏫</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-crucial-role-of-mentoring-and-community-for-women-in-stem-field"><span style="color: #ec3a8b;">The Crucial Role of Mentoring and Community for Women in STEM field</span> 🌟</h3>
<p>Emilyn’s commitment to mentorship is also fueled by literature and research beyond her primary area of expertise. One article that recently inspired her is “Women in STEM: The Importance of Mentorship and Community” by Prof.&nbsp;Michaela Gazdik Stofer, published by the American Society for Microbiology. The full text can be accessed <a href="https://asm.org/articles/2024/october/women-stem-importance-mentorship-community"><em>clicking here</em></a>. 😉</p>
<p>Prof.&nbsp;Stofer identifies several structural challenges commonly faced by women in STEM:</p>
<p>✔️ <strong>Gender bias:</strong> Both conscious and unconscious biases that influence hiring, promotion, and recognition.</p>
<p>✔️ <strong>Imposter syndrome:</strong> A persistent feeling among many women that they do not belong, despite their qualifications.</p>
<p>✔️ <strong>Lack of representation:</strong> Fewer women in senior roles result in a scarcity of mentors and role models for early-career professionals.</p>
<p>✔️ <strong>Work-life balance pressures:</strong> Disproportionate responsibilities outside of work often hinder women’s advancement in the field.</p>
<p>In response to these challenges, Prof.&nbsp;Michaela Stofer highlights mentorship and the formation of supportive communities as crucial mechanisms for progress. Emilyn’s own journey echoes this sentiment—she continues to work toward building inclusive spaces where knowledge is shared, mentorship is prioritized, and the next generation of women in STEM can thrive.</p>
<p>IGNITE directly addresses these challenges by providing mentorship and fostering a supportive community.</p>

<section id="o-que-é-o-ignite" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="o-que-é-o-ignite"><span style="color: #856A00;">O que é o IGNITE?</span></h2>
<p>A palavra “ignite”, segundo o dicionário, significa “pegar fogo ou causar combustão” ou “despertar ou inflamar uma emoção ou situação”. Metaforicamente, ignite representa acender a paixão, a inspiração ou provocar uma onda intensa de atividade ou emoção. Pode descrever o despertar do entusiasmo, o acender de uma chama interior ou o desencadeamento de uma mudança poderosa ou transformadora.</p>
<p>Foi assim que nasceu a ideia do <span style="color: #856A00;">IGNITE</span>, que aqui significa <span style="color: #ec3a8b;">Inspirando Garotas através de Networking, Inovação e Excelência Técnica</span>.</p>
<p>IGNITE é um programa de mentoria de médio prazo, pensado para apoiar e fortalecer a próxima geração de mulheres na ciência.</p>
</section>
<section id="quem-está-envolvido" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quem-está-envolvido"><span style="color: #856A00;">Quem está envolvido?</span></h2>
<p>O coração do IGNITE é a fundadora e mentora principal, Dra. Emilyn Costa. Ela convidou cuidadosamente mulheres incríveis de sua rede profissional – especialistas em diversas áreas científicas – para compartilharem, de forma generosa, seus conhecimentos valiosos e experiências práticas.</p>
<p>A Dra. Emilyn Costa conta também com a colaboração de Layana Rufino, uma talentosa mestranda e sua orientanda. Layana contribui com sua excelência em comunicação científica e divulgação.</p>
<p>Somos profundamente gratas a todas as mulheres inspiradoras que participam do IGNITE como voluntárias, dedicando seu tempo e expertise para fortalecer esta iniciativa tão importante.</p>

<section id="quem-apoiamos" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quem-apoiamos"><span style="color: #856A00;">Quem apoiamos?</span></h2>
<p>O IGNITE foi criado especialmente para meninas e mulheres em formação nas carreiras científicas, abrangendo desde a graduação, passando pela pós-graduação (mestrado, doutorado) até o estágio de pós-doutorado.</p>
</section>
<section id="por-que-o-ignite-é-importante" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="por-que-o-ignite-é-importante"><span style="color: #856A00;">Por que o IGNITE é importante?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #ec3a8b;">Acendendo a Inspiração através do Desejo de Mudança</span> 🌟</p>
<p>A Dra. Emilyn Costa Conceição Sharma 👩‍🔬 🇧🇷 obteve seu doutorado no Brasil durante um período de instabilidade política e desinvestimento em ciência. Apesar do suporte do governo brasileiro para sua formação, a mudança no partido político no poder - clique aqui para saber mais - levou à instabilidade e à diáspora de profissionais altamente qualificados.</p>
<p>Sem oportunidades de pós-doutorado e sem experiência anterior na indústria, Emilyn precisou retirar os títulos “Dra.” e “MSc” de seu currículo para tentar vagas no setor privado. Uma dessas oportunidades foi na administração de uma unidade de saúde 🏥, com salário equivalente ao mínimo nacional – possível de ser alcançado apenas com o ensino médio.</p>
<p>Em uma reviravolta inesperada, ao ajudar um colega de doutorado em situação similar, foi convidada a integrar o laboratório de bacteriologia diagnóstica (Labbact) no INI/FIOCRUZ como tecnóloga de laboratório (função equivalente a assistente de pesquisa). Essa oportunidade marcou seu retorno à ciência e o início de seu primeiro estágio pós-doutoral. 🔬</p>
<p>Sua experiência prática em pesquisa clínica e diagnóstico da tuberculose resultou em um convite para desenvolver um projeto de pós-doutorado na Bélgica 🇧🇪. Na época, ela teve que escolher entre seguir na Europa 🌍 ou coordenar as atividades laboratoriais de um ensaio clínico de genômica da TB na África do Sul 🇿🇦 – tema que sempre a fascinou. Escolheu a África do Sul, movida pelo compromisso com doenças que impactam países do Sul Global, como o Brasil e a África do Sul. A posição prometia não apenas crescimento científico 🌱, mas também a troca significativa de conhecimentos.</p>
<p>Na África do Sul, foi incentivada a buscar financiamento independente, mas enfrentou grandes dificuldades. A curta duração dos contratos de pós-doc, a falta de tempo dedicado à escrita de projetos ✍️ e a inelegibilidade devido à nacionalidade ou residência comprometeram suas chances. 😔</p>
<p>Com o tempo, descobriu-se em um “vácuo profissional”: não mais considerada pesquisadora em início de carreira (por ter ultrapassado três anos pós-PhD), mas também sem ter sido PI (pesquisadora principal) de projetos independentes. Isso a colocou em um espaço sem gravidade profissional, sem base sólida para crescer. 🚀</p>
<p>Apesar dos desafios, a Dra. Costa Conceição adquiriu habilidades valiosas: gestão de projetos, comunicação científica, controle de qualidade, pensamento estratégico, liderança e autogestão. Sobretudo, aprendeu sobre o poder transformador das comunidades científicas. 🤝</p>
<p>Acreditando no poder coletivo do compartilhamento de conhecimento, Emilyn estruturou suas experiências em um currículo para apoiar meninas e mulheres, expandindo horizontes para além dos sistemas tradicionais de educação e promovendo a escolha consciente de seus caminhos profissionais. 👩‍🏫</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="o-papel-crucial-da-mentoria-e-da-comunidade-para-mulheres-em-stem"><span style="color: #ec3a8b;">O papel crucial da Mentoria e da Comunidade para Mulheres em STEM</span> 🌟</h2>
<p>O compromisso de Emilyn com a mentoria é fortalecido também por pesquisas fora de sua área de formação. Um artigo recente que a inspirou foi “Women in STEM: The Importance of Mentorship and Community”, da professora Michaela Gazdik Stofer, publicado pela American Society for Microbiology. O texto completo está disponível clicando aqui. 😉</p>
<p>A Professora Stofer aponta vários desafios estruturais enfrentados por mulheres em STEM:</p>
<p>✔️ Preconceito de gênero: Bias consciente e inconsciente no recrutamento, promoção e reconhecimento.</p>
<p>✔️ Síndrome da impostora: Sensação persistente de não pertencimento, mesmo sendo altamente qualificadas.</p>
<p>✔️ Falta de representatividade: Poucas mulheres em cargos de liderança resultam em escassez de mentoras e modelos.</p>
<p>✔️ Pressões de conciliação vida pessoal/profissional: Responsabilidades desproporcionais fora do trabalho impactam o progresso na carreira.</p>
<p>Como resposta, a professora destaca a mentoria e a construção de comunidades de apoio como elementos cruciais para o avanço. A trajetória de Emilyn reflete essa visão – ela trabalha continuamente para criar espaços inclusivos e colaborativos para mulheres em STEM.</p>
<p>IGNITE surge como resposta direta a esses desafios, oferecendo mentoria e construindo uma comunidade de apoio.</p>
