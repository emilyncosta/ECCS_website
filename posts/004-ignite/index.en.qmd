Hi there! I know there was no post in March… but today I’m here to make up for it with a detailed update! I’ve been writing a lot behind the scenes. 🌸💻✍️

At the end of February, I traveled to India for personal reasons. ✈️🇮🇳✨ It was an intense experience — one that could fill an entire blog with reflections! But I think these stories are better suited for intimate chats with friends. If anyone wants to meet for an “e-coffee,” let me know, and we’ll schedule a day! 😅

Unfortunately, I experienced the infamous “Delhi-belly” 🥴 and ended up with a "bella" intestinal infection. My microbiome suffered, poor thing… but everything is under control now! 💪 I also dealt with a stubborn respiratory infection — the kind that takes a while to go away. But all is well now. 🌬️💊

Back to academic life, it was time to catch up on work and resume self-care. And in this spirit of renewal, I’m here to share with you a new dream that is starting to take shape as a project: Project IGNITE! 🚀🔥 Warning: long text ahead! 😅📚

It’s still in its embryonic stage, but I’ve shared some details clicking here. 😉

And I’d like to extend a special invitation to you: what kind of mentorship would you like to have, beyond what I’ve already mentioned in the link? 💡 Do you have any ideas? Any suggestions? I’d love to hear from you!

Write to me at emilyncosta@gmail.com or send me a direct message on social media (I’m not always there, but I check in weekly).
It will be a pleasure to “read” your thoughts. 💬💛

Emilyn Costa.
