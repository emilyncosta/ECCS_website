<p>Hi there! I know there was no post in March… but today I’m here to make up for it with a detailed update! I’ve been writing a lot behind the scenes. 🌸💻✍️</p>
<p>At the end of February, I traveled to India for personal reasons. ✈️🇮🇳✨ It was an intense experience — one that could fill an entire blog with reflections! But I think these stories are better suited for intimate chats with friends. If anyone wants to meet for an “e-coffee,” let me know, and we’ll schedule a day! 😅</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I experienced the infamous “Delhi-belly” 🥴 and ended up with a “bella” intestinal infection. My microbiome suffered, poor thing… but everything is under control now! 💪 I also dealt with a stubborn respiratory infection — the kind that takes a while to go away. But all is well now. 🌬️💊</p>
<p>Back to academic life, it was time to catch up on work and resume self-care. And in this spirit of renewal, I’m here to share with you a new dream that is starting to take shape as a project: Project IGNITE! 🚀🔥 Warning: long text ahead! 😅📚</p>
<p>It’s still in its embryonic stage, but I’ve shared some details clicking here. 😉</p>
<p>And I’d like to extend a special invitation to you: what kind of mentorship would you like to have, beyond what I’ve already mentioned in the link? 💡 Do you have any ideas? Any suggestions? I’d love to hear from you!</p>
<p>Write to me at emilyncosta@gmail.com or send me a direct message on social media (I’m not always there, but I check in weekly). It will be a pleasure to “read” your thoughts. 💬💛</p>
<p>Emilyn Costa.</p>

<p>Oiê! Não teve post em março, eu sei… mas hoje vim compensar com um update caprichado!</p>
<p>Escrevi bastante coisa nos bastidores. 🌸💻✍️</p>
<p>Lá no finalzinho de fevereiro, embarquei para a Índia por motivos pessoais. ✈️🇮🇳✨ Foi uma experiência intensa — dessas que dariam um blog inteiro de reflexões! Mas acho que essas histórias vão ficar mesmo para os papos mais íntimos com os amigos. Quem quiser reunir para um “e-coffe” me diz que agendamos o dia! 😅</p>
<p>Infelizmente, tive o famoso “Delhi-belly” 🥴 e acabei com uma bela infecção intestinal. Meu microbioma sofreu, coitadinho… mas já está tudo sob controle! 💪 Ah, também encarei uma infecção respiratória teimosa — dessas que custam a passar. Mas tá tudo certo agora. 🌬️💊</p>
<p>De volta à vida acadêmica, foi hora de correr atrás do trabalho acumulado e retomar o autocuidado. E é nesse clima de renascimento que venho compartilhar com vocês um novo sonho que começa a ganhar forma de projeto: o Projeto IGNITE! 🚀🔥 Aviso: textão chegando! 😅📚</p>
<p>Ele ainda está em fase embrionária, mas já deixei alguns detalhes clicando aqui. 😉</p>
<p>E aproveito pra te fazer um convite especial: que tipo de mentoria você gostaria de ter, além do que já contei no link? 💡 Tem alguma ideia? Alguma sugestão? Quero muito te ouvir!</p>
<p>Me escreve no e-mail emilyncosta@gmail.com ou me manda uma mensagem direta nas redes sociais (não tô sempre lá, mas toda semana dou uma passadinha).</p>
<p>Vai ser um prazer “ler” os seus pensamentos. 💬💛</p>

<p>“We are not a team because we work together. We are a team because we trust, respect, and care for each other.” — Vala Afshar</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="text-align: justify">
<p>Look at this consistency, folks!</p>
<p>Two posts on this blog in two months! 🤭 I’m impressed with myself! January has barely started, but it already feels like an entire year has passed! Between professional decisions and the eternal geopolitical chaos, I decided to talk about a topic that’s been part of our lives forever: collaborations 🤝!</p>
<p>We’re constantly connecting with other people, either because we choose to or because “we were chosen.” But since reality isn’t always rosy, I’ll set aside the negative part and focus on what really matters: how to recognize the different types of collaboration we have and, more importantly, how to make them more productive and pleasant.</p>
<p>So, let’s reflect: how many of these collaborations do we actually have? And, most importantly, in how many of them are we “the pleasant ones”? Just one detail: I’m not an academic specialist on this subject, but as a scientist, I have plenty of experience to share. And that’s what this post is all about!</p>
<section id="project-management-essential-for-life" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="project-management-essential-for-life">Project management: essential for life</h2>
<p>It might not seem related, but this topic is totally connected to our theme. I’ve always thought Project Management should be a mandatory course in all degrees because, in practice, our life is full of projects – even if we don’t call them that.</p>
<p>And I’m not just talking about that basic scientific methodology course on how to create and develop projects, but mainly about how to manage them. In this regard, I notice that industry is far ahead of academia. Those who don’t learn this in practice often need to pursue a specialization or MBA after graduation, which is expensive, and by then, we’ve already wasted a lot of time managing our undergraduate research projects and thesis in an amateur way.</p>
<p>The fact is that knowing how to manage projects makes collaborations more enjoyable, productive, and lighter. Here, I’ll focus on some aspects that I consider fundamental:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communication and responsiveness</li>
<li>Task division, deadlines, and follow-up</li>
<li>Working with visibility and consistency</li>
<li>Patience</li>
<li>Meetings (if necessary!)</li>
<li>Authorship planning</li>
<li>A coffee (or “e-coffee”)</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="communication-and-responsiveness" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="communication-and-responsiveness">Communication and responsiveness</h2>
<p>In science, we communicate all the time: presentations, meetings, requests for help, courses, events, emails… In the midst of all this, our social battery sometimes crashes (here in South Africa they call it load-shedding, the scheduled power outages that we even track with an app! 😂).</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If observation/experimentation and reproducibility are the brain of science, communication is its soul.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If multiple people are copied on an email, we need to respond to everyone when the update is relevant to the group. Otherwise, we can respond privately. Seems basic, but we don’t always follow this logic.</p>
<p>Now, about using WhatsApp for everything: I’m naturally against it! Family, friends, and work on the same app? Exhausting! I think email should remain the main tool for professional communication, while WhatsApp should be used for quick, urgent messages or to alert someone about an email sent.</p>
<p>The problem is that, besides emails and WhatsApp, we still have Teams, Slack, GitHub, platforms from A to Z, and social networks like LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter… Oh my! 🙃 All these apps have been removed from my phone (except WhatsApp) because it’s impossible to be accessible on all platforms, at any time and anywhere.</p>
<p>About seven years ago, I started using project management tools, but the problem is that there are many and none connect them all. In the end, we always go back to emails… Today, I use a platform for personal planning, which helps me organize other aspects.</p>
<p>But regardless of the tool, some good practices are essential:</p>
<p>✅ Be polite and kind in communication ✅ Be clear and objective ✅ Include the right people in the conversation ✅ Be responsive – you don’t need to reply instantly, but have a fixed time to check emails.</p>
<p>By the way, one day I want to invite a professional to give a talk about how to improve our relationship with emails and written communication. In Brazil, we don’t have this strong culture, but we should.</p>
</section>
<section id="task-division-deadlines-and-follow-up" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="task-division-deadlines-and-follow-up">Task division, deadlines, and follow-up</h2>
<p>The success of a collaboration depends on a balance in the division of tasks. Often, the most efficient people end up overloaded, and this blocks the process. Tasks without a defined deadline tend to drag on forever. And when someone sits on a task for months, holding up the progress of the rest of the project? Frustrating! Therefore, besides distributing responsibilities well and setting realistic deadlines, regular follow-up is fundamental. Weekly, biweekly, or monthly meetings can prevent this type of problem.</p>
</section>
<section id="working-with-visibility-and-consistency" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="working-with-visibility-and-consistency">Working with visibility and consistency</h2>
<p>Keeping the group updated is essential: ✔️ Sending meeting minutes ✔️ Informing about delays or unforeseen events (lost sample, delayed reagent, failed experiment, vacation…) ✔️ Reporting results – including negative ones!</p>
<p>What matters isn’t perfection, but consistency.</p>
</section>
<section id="patience" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="patience">Patience</h2>
<p>No scientist works on a single project with a single group. We’re multi-everything! This means that, by default, we’re always busy, but we can organize ourselves to meet deadlines. If we can’t finish something within the expected time, pressure like “I need it yesterday” doesn’t help. Who hasn’t already been swamped and received an urgent task out of nowhere? That’s our routine.</p>
<p>The best approach is: 🔹 Ask for more time, if necessary 🔹 Delegate to someone else, if possible 🔹 Don’t let it affect your mental health! Work gets resolved, burnout doesn’t.</p>
</section>
<section id="meetings-if-necessary" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="meetings-if-necessary">Meetings (if necessary!)</h2>
<p>There are meetings that could be resolved by email and emails that should be short meetings. The secret lies in balance. I like objective and short meetings: 40 minutes biweekly, for example, is usually enough to keep the team aligned without hindering productivity.</p>
</section>
<section id="authorship-planning" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="authorship-planning">Authorship planning</h2>
<p>This should be the first topic in any collaboration. Defining roles and positions right at the beginning avoids future conflicts. Whoever did more should get more credit. Here’s an essential reference for this: 🔗 CRediT – Author Statement</p>
</section>
<section id="a-coffee-or-e-coffee" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-coffee-or-e-coffee">A coffee (or “e-coffee”) ☕</h2>
<p>In the end, we’re not robots. If we’re in the same environment, a coffee or a walk around campus can be great for maintaining the bond between collaborators.</p>
<p>For those who are far away, why not a virtual coffee? The last time I did this with a friend in the Netherlands, she had porridge and I had coffee. It was a fun 45-minute catch-up that made all the difference in the week!</p>
<p>I wrote all this also as a reminder to myself – because I’m still learning to be a good collaborator (not perfect!) 🤲. I’ve also been encouraging students to adopt these practices.</p>
<p>If you have reading suggestions, comments, or criticisms, let me know 💡!</p>
<p>Until next time and thank you for the “privilege of your attention” – a phrase I stole from a movie whose name I’ve already forgotten. 😆</p>

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p>Olha só quanta consistência, pessoal!</p>
<p>Dois textos neste blog em dois meses! 🤭 Tô impressionada comigo mesma! Janeiro mal começou, mas já parece que um ano inteiro passou! Entre decisões profissionais e o eterno caos geopolítico, resolvi falar sobre um tema que faz parte da nossa vida desde sempre: colaborações 🤝!</p>
<p>A gente vive se conectando com outras pessoas, seja porque escolhemos ou porque “fomos escolhidos”. Mas, como a realidade nem sempre é cor-de-rosa, vou deixar de lado a parte negativa e focar no que realmente importa: como reconhecer os diferentes tipos de colaboração que temos e, mais do que isso, como torná-las mais produtivas e legais.</p>
<p>Então, bora refletir: quantas dessas colaborações a gente realmente tem? E, o mais importante, em quantas delas nós somos “os legais”? Ah, só um detalhe: não sou especialista acadêmica nesse assunto, mas, como cientista, tenho experiência de sobra para compartilhar. E é disso que esse texto se trata!</p>
<section id="gerenciamento-de-projetos-essencial-para-a-vida" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gerenciamento-de-projetos-essencial-para-a-vida">Gerenciamento de projetos: essencial para a vida</h2>
<p>Pode não parecer, mas esse assunto está totalmente relacionado ao tema. Sempre achei que Gerenciamento de Projetos deveria ser uma disciplina obrigatória em todos os cursos, porque, na prática, nossa vida é cheia de projetos – mesmo que a gente não chame assim.</p>
<p>E não estou falando só daquela disciplina básica de metodologia científica sobre como criar e desenvolver projetos, mas, principalmente, sobre como gerenciá-los. Nesse ponto, percebo que a indústria está muito à frente da academia. Quem não aprende isso na prática, muitas vezes precisa fazer uma especialização ou MBA depois do diploma, o que é caro e, até lá, já perdemos muito tempo gerenciando nossos projetos de iniciação científica e TCC de forma amadora.</p>
<p>O fato é que saber gerenciar projetos torna as colaborações mais prazerosas, produtivas e leves. Aqui, vou focar em alguns aspectos que considero fundamentais:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comunicação e responsividade</li>
<li>Divisão de tarefas, prazos e acompanhamento</li>
<li>Trabalho com visibilidade e consistência</li>
<li>Paciência</li>
<li>Reuniões (se necessárias!)</li>
<li>Planejamento de autoria</li>
<li>Um café (ou “e-café”)</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="comunicação-e-responsividade" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="comunicação-e-responsividade">Comunicação e responsividade</h2>
<p>Na ciência, nos comunicamos o tempo todo: apresentações, reuniões, pedidos de ajuda, cursos, eventos, emails… No meio disso tudo, nossa bateria social às vezes dá umas panes (aqui na África do Sul chamam de load-shedding, os apagões programados de energia que até acompanhamos por um app! 😂).</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Se a observação/experimentação e a reprodutibilidade são o cérebro da ciência, a comunicação é a alma.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Se há várias pessoas copiadas num email, precisamos responder a todos quando a atualização for relevante para o grupo. Caso contrário, podemos responder em particular. Parece básico, mas nem sempre seguimos essa lógica.</p>
<p>Agora, sobre WhatsApp para tudo: sou contra por natureza! Família, amigos e trabalho no mesmo app? Exaustivo! Acho que o email deveria continuar sendo a principal ferramenta de comunicação profissional, enquanto o WhatsApp deveria servir para mensagens rápidas, urgentes ou para alertar sobre um email enviado.</p>
<p>O problema é que, além de emails e WhatsApp, ainda temos Teams, Slack, GitHub, plataformas de A a Z e redes sociais como LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter… Puxa vida! 🙃 Todos esses apps foram removidos do meu celular (exceto o WhatsApp) porque não dá para ser acessível em todas as plataformas, a qualquer hora e em qualquer lugar.</p>
<p>Há uns sete anos, comecei a usar ferramentas de gerenciamento de projetos, mas o problema é que existem muitas e nenhuma conecta todas. No fim, sempre voltamos para os emails… Hoje, uso uma plataforma para planejamento pessoal, o que me ajuda a organizar os demais aspectos.</p>
<p>Mas, independentemente da ferramenta, algumas boas práticas são essenciais:</p>
<p>✅ Seja educado e gentil na comunicação ✅ Seja claro e objetivo ✅ Inclua as pessoas certas na conversa ✅ Seja responsivo – não precisa responder instantaneamente, mas tenha um horário fixo para checar e-mails.</p>
<p>Aliás, um dia quero convidar um profissional para dar uma palestra sobre como melhorar nossa relação com emails e comunicação escrita. No Brasil, não temos essa cultura forte, mas deveríamos.</p>
</section>
<section id="divisão-de-tarefas-prazos-e-acompanhamento" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="divisão-de-tarefas-prazos-e-acompanhamento">Divisão de tarefas, prazos e acompanhamento</h2>
<p>O sucesso de uma colaboração depende de um equilíbrio na divisão das tarefas. Muitas vezes, as pessoas mais eficientes acabam sobrecarregadas, e isso trava o processo. Tarefas sem prazo definido tendem a se arrastar para sempre. E quando alguém fica meses sentado em uma tarefa, segurando o andamento do resto do projeto? Frustrante! Por isso, além de distribuir bem as responsabilidades e definir prazos realistas, o acompanhamento regular é fundamental. Reuniões semanais, quinzenais ou mensais podem evitar esse tipo de problema.</p>
</section>
<section id="trabalho-com-visibilidade-e-consistência" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="trabalho-com-visibilidade-e-consistência">Trabalho com visibilidade e consistência</h2>
<p>Manter o grupo atualizado é essencial:</p>
<p>✔️ Enviar atas das reuniões ✔️ Informar sobre atrasos ou imprevistos (amostra perdida, reagente atrasado, experimento que deu errado, férias…) ✔️ Reportar resultados – inclusive os negativos!</p>
<p>O importante não é a perfeição, mas a consistência.</p>
</section>
<section id="paciência" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="paciência">Paciência</h2>
<p>Nenhum cientista trabalha em um único projeto com um único grupo. Somos multi-tudo! Isso significa que, por padrão, estamos sempre ocupados, mas podemos nos organizar para cumprir prazos. Se não conseguimos finalizar algo no tempo previsto, não adianta pressão do tipo “pra ontem”. Quem já não estava atolado e recebeu uma tarefa urgente do nada? Essa é a nossa rotina.</p>
<p>A melhor abordagem é:</p>
<p>🔹 Pedir mais tempo, se necessário 🔹 Delegar para outra pessoa, se possível 🔹 Não deixar que isso afete sua saúde mental! Trabalho se resolve, burnout não.</p>
</section>
<section id="reuniões-se-necessário" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reuniões-se-necessário">Reuniões (se necessário!)</h2>
<p>Tem reuniões que poderiam ser resolvidas por e-mail e emails que deveriam ser reuniões curtas. O segredo está no equilíbrio.</p>
<p>Eu gosto de reuniões objetivas e curtas: 40 minutos quinzenalmente, por exemplo, costuma ser suficiente para manter a equipe alinhada sem atrapalhar a produtividade.</p>
</section>
<section id="planejamento-de-autoria" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="planejamento-de-autoria">Planejamento de autoria</h2>
<p>Esse deveria ser o primeiro tópico em qualquer colaboração. Definir papéis e posições logo no início evita conflitos futuros. Quem fez mais, deve ter mais crédito. Aqui está uma referência essencial para isso:</p>
<p>🔗 CRediT – Author Statement</p>
</section>
<section id="um-café-ou-e-café" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="um-café-ou-e-café">Um café (ou “e-café”) ☕</h2>
<p>No fim das contas, não somos robôs. Se estivermos no mesmo ambiente, um café ou uma caminhada pelo campus pode ser ótimo para manter o vínculo entre os colaboradores.</p>
<p>Para quem está longe, por que não um café virtual? Da última vez que fiz isso com uma amiga na Holanda, ela tomou mingau e eu, café. Foi um catch-up divertido de 45 minutos que fez toda a diferença na semana!</p>
<p>Escrevi tudo isso também como um lembrete para mim mesma – porque ainda estou aprendendo a ser uma boa colaboradora (não perfeita!) 🤲. Também tenho incentivado alunos a adotarem essas práticas.</p>
<p>Se tiver sugestões de leitura, comentários ou críticas, me avise 💡!</p>
<p>Até a próxima e obrigada pelo “privilégio da sua atenção” – frase que roubei de um filme cujo nome já esqueci. 😆</p>

<p>“Accountability breeds response-ability.” — Stephen R. Covey</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="two-years-a-sooner-and-the-importance-of-accountability">Two Years, a “Sooner,” and the Importance of “Accountability”!</h2>
<p>Today is January 7, 2025 — two years since my first post in 2023. And here I am, with my “sooner” (Help! 😅 — Well, this “help” makes more sense in Brazil, but I’ll leave it here 🤪). Reflecting on this period, I see that 2023 and 2024 were years of professional doubts and challenges. Since life doesn’t fit into neat boxes, these challenges ended up impacting all areas of my life. I’m still a postdoc at Stellenbosch University, in the same research group (<span class="citation" data-cites="TBGenomics">@TBGenomics</span> 🫶🏽).</p>
<p>Today, I want to talk about something I learned during this process: the importance of <strong>“accountability”</strong> 🫂.</p>
<p>You know that word that doesn’t have an exact translation into Portuguese? For me, this word means having a solid support network, people I can count on, share my worries with, and celebrate achievements. It encompasses the concepts of reliability, responsibility, and commitment. “Accountability” goes beyond meeting deadlines or achieving results; it’s about having someone to rely on — someone to share difficulties and multiply strengths. And believe me, this makes all the difference in the life of a scientist 👩🏾‍🔬🧑🏼‍🔬!</p>
<p>We live in a whirlwind of deadlines, unfinished papers, experiments that need to be planned, executed, and often repeated, events… It’s easy to feel overwhelmed and lost. That’s why having colleagues who understand, inspire, and motivate you is essential. People with whom you can be vulnerable, talk about career challenges, and even vent about that “backstabber” you encountered at the expensive conference you paid to attend.</p>
<p>Speaking of conferences, it’s wonderful to reconnect with colleagues/friends, meet new people, and stay updated on the latest discoveries. It’s like a shot of adrenaline! You leave there wanting to win the Nobel Prize (who hasn’t?! 🤪).</p>
<p>But, in the end, what I value most are the connections I make, the hallway conversations, the shared coffees… It’s in this environment that “accountability” can flourish. How great it is to reconnect with colleagues from other continents, talk about protocols and pipelines, but also about aspects of our cultures, geopolitics, cuisine, history, etc.</p>
<p>For those who think the best part of a conference is the tourism, I say that comes second (and you say: “yeah, right!” 😅). The real highlight is reconnecting with dear colleagues, exchanging ideas with new contacts, and getting a preview of the latest in science before it’s even published. I often say that conference proceedings are like a literature review in a relaxed environment, with brilliant minds and esteemed colleagues. Of course, every now and then, we encounter the dreaded “backstabbers,” but even they are part of the learning process.</p>
<p>Today, I want to thank my support network, which might not even reach five people 🥹.<br>
They are colleagues who share the lab and office with me or those who, even from afar, share experiences and support. <strong>They help me navigate the uncertainties of my career.</strong></p>
<p>These are the people I can talk to about the challenges of academic life: being a scientist in and from the Global South, a woman, a foreigner, and part of a “limbo” called “early-mid career,” trying to find my place in this academic system that, let’s face it, leaves much to be desired… But that’s a topic for another post! (I’ll refine my “logo” definition, I promise! 🫡).</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>🌟 My message to you, dear reader:</strong></p>
<p>Cultivate your collaborative network, but also your emotional and professional support network.<br>
Invest in “accountability”!<br>
Use scientific events, coffee breaks, walks, or online meetings as opportunities to strengthen these connections.<br>
Choose mentors carefully. Not every supervisor will be your mentor, and that’s okay. When mentorship and supervision align, it’s wonderful, but it doesn’t always happen.<br>
<strong>Choose those you can “count on” 🙋🏻‍♀️ 💁🏿 🙆🏻‍♂️ 🙅🏿‍♀️ 🙆🏽‍♀️.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>May your journey be filled with people to share challenges and celebrate achievements 🫰🏽!</strong></p>
<hr>
<div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic;">
<p>P.S.: I hope to stick to the resolutions I made in 2023 throughout 2025 😅.<br>
Creating a space to share my experiences has been on my resolution list since 2010, but it was only in 2023 that I took the idea off the paper (or rather, out of the subfolders!). See you soon! I’m already starting to draft the next post. I think publishing monthly would be a sustainable frequency, don’t you think?<br>
If you’ve read this far and resonated with the topic, I’d love to hear your opinion 🤲🏽!<br>
Share your thoughts (emilyncosta@gmail.com) or tag me on social media (<span class="citation" data-cites="emilyncosta">@emilyncosta</span>). (well, my Instagran is privated, but you can find me on other online spaces :) ) Although I’m not a social media queen, I promise to reply with great pleasure. 😊</p>

<p>“‘Accountability’ gera capacidade de resposta.” — Stephen R. Covey</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dois-anos-um-logo-e-a-importância-da-accountability">Dois anos, um “logo” e a importância da “accountability”!</h2>
<p>Hoje é 7 de janeiro de 2025 — dois anos desde a minha primeira publicação de 2023. E aqui estou, com meu “logo” (Socorro! 😅). Refletindo sobre esse período, vejo que 2023 e 2024 foram anos de dúvidas e desafios profissionais. Como a vida não se divide em caixinhas, esses desafios acabaram impactando todas as áreas da minha vida. Continuo como pós-doc na Universidade de Stellenbosch, no mesmo grupo de pesquisa (<span class="citation" data-cites="TBGenomics">@TBGenomics</span> 🫶🏽).</p>
<p>Hoje quero falar sobre algo que aprendi nesse processo: a importância da <strong>“accountability”</strong> 🫂.</p>
<p>Sabe aquela palavra que não tem tradução exata para o português? Para mim, essa palavra significa ter uma rede de apoio sólida, pessoas com quem posso contar, dividir minhas angústias e celebrar conquistas. Ela carrega os conceitos de confiabilidade, responsabilidade e compromisso. “Accountability” vai além de cumprir prazos ou alcançar resultados; trata-se de ter com quem contar — alguém para dividir dificuldades e multiplicar forças. E acredite, isso faz toda a diferença na vida de um(a) cientista 👩🏾‍🔬🧑🏼‍🔬!</p>
<p>A gente vive em um turbilhão de prazos, artigos inacabados, experimentos que precisam ser planejados, executados e muitas vezes repetidos, eventos… É fácil se sentir sobrecarregado e perdido.<br>
Por isso, ter colegas que te entendem, te inspiram e te motivam é fundamental. Pessoas com quem você pode ser vulnerável, falar sobre os desafios da carreira, e até desabafar sobre aquele “puxa-tapete” que você encontrou no congresso caro que você pagou pra ir.</p>
<p>Aliás, falando em congressos, é maravilhoso reencontrar colegas/amigos, conhecer gente nova e ficar por dentro das últimas descobertas. É como uma injeção de ânimo! A gente sai de lá querendo ganhar o Nobel (quem nunca?! 🤪). Mas, no final das contas, o que mais valorizo são as conexões que crio, as conversas de corredor, os cafés compartilhados… É nesse ambiente que uma “accountability” pode florescer.<br>
Como é bom reencontrar colegas de outros continentes, falar de protocolos e pipelines, mas também dos aspectos das nossas culturas, da geopolítica, da culinária, da História, etc.</p>
<p>Para quem pensa que a melhor parte de um congresso é o turismo, digo que isso vem em segundo lugar (aí você fala: “uhum, sei!” 😅). O verdadeiro brilho está em reencontrar colegas queridos, trocar ideias com novos contatos e ter uma prévia do que há de mais recente na ciência, antes mesmo de ser publicado.</p>
<p>Costumo dizer que os anais de um congresso são como uma revisão da literatura em um ambiente descontraído, com mentes brilhantes e colegas estimados.<br>
É claro que, vez ou outra, encontramos os temidos “puxa-tapetes”, mas até eles fazem parte do aprendizado.</p>
<p>Hoje, quero agradecer à minha rede de apoio, que talvez não chegue a cinco pessoas 🥹.<br>
São colegas que dividem comigo a bancada e escritório ou aqueles que, mesmo de longe, compartilham experiências e apoio. <strong>Eles me ajudam a navegar pelas incertezas da carreira.</strong></p>
<p>São essas pessoas com quem posso conversar sobre os desafios da vida acadêmica: ser cientista no e do hemisfério sul, mulher, estrangeira e parte de um “limbo” chamado “early-mid career” (início-meio de carreira), tentando se encontrar nesse sistema acadêmico que, convenhamos, deixa muito a desejar…<br>
Mas isso é assunto para outro post! (Vou limpar a definição do meu “logo”, prometo! 🫡).</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>🌟 Minha mensagem para você, leitor(a):</strong></p>
<p>Cultive sua rede colaborativa, mas também sua rede de suporte emocional e profissional.<br>
Invista em “accountability”!<br>
Use eventos científicos, cafés, caminhadas ou encontros online como oportunidades para fortalecer essas conexões.<br>
Escolha mentores com cuidado. Nem todo orientador será seu mentor, e tudo bem. Quando mentoria e supervisão se combinam, é maravilhoso, mas nem sempre acontece.<br>
<strong>Escolha aqueles com quem você pode “contar” 🙋🏻‍♀️ 💁🏿 🙆🏻‍♂️ 🙅🏿‍♀️ 🙆🏽‍♀️.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Que sua jornada seja repleta de pessoas com quem dividir desafios e celebrar conquistas 🫰🏽!</strong></p>
<hr>
<div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic;">
<p>P.S.: Espero conseguir seguir em 2025 com as resoluções que fiz em 2023 😅.<br>
Criar um espaço para compartilhar minhas experiências está na minha lista de resoluções desde 2010, mas só em 2023 tirei a ideia do papel (ou melhor, das subpastas!).<br>
Até logo mesmo! Já vou começar a rascunhar o texto do próximo post.<br>
Acho que publicar mensalmente seria uma periodicidade sustentável, não acha?<br>
Se você leu até aqui e se identificou com o tema, gostaria de saber sua opinião 🤲🏽!<br>
Compartilhe suas reflexões (emilyncosta@gmail.com) ou me marque nas redes sociais (<span class="citation" data-cites="emilyncosta">@emilyncosta</span>) (Bem, na verdade o meu Instagram é privado, mas estou disponível em outras redes sociais :) ).<br>

<p>“I don’t like words worn out by information. I have more respect for those that live belly-down on the ground.”<br>

<section id="hey-you-reader" class="level2" style="text-align: justify">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hey-you-reader">Hey you, reader!</h2>
<p>Putting aside my reluctance to introduce myself publicly, I’m starting this journey for basically three reasons:</p>
<p><strong>1. First</strong>, because it might help you at some point in your professional journey, whether through my mistakes or my achievements;</p>
<p><strong>2. Second</strong>, because you might want to join one of the study groups I run on weekends, either in Portuguese or English (more details here);</p>
<p><strong>3. Finally</strong>, because we might create or join a new and exciting initiative for society. How great would that be?</p>
<p>Well, let’s move on to the proper introductions, professionally speaking. After all, we are not defined by our degrees — they are just an important part of life, but not <em>the</em> most important one…</p>
<p>My name is Emilyn Costa Conceição Sharma, and I’m from Belém, Pará, Brazil. Despite the challenges my family and educators faced in getting me interested in studying during childhood, their persistence worked — and here I am.</p>
<p>After a not-so-traditional journey, I fell in love with knowledge, and it became like magic chocolate: the more I consumed, the more there was to enjoy.<br>
At that time, I had no internet, cellphone, or even TV access. My entire knowledge source came from formal education (school) and informal education (my grandmother’s library — she was a teacher). I went through many schools, experienced bullying, traumas, new beginnings, and later, found places that became emotional, intellectual, social, and protective oases.</p>
<p>This background made me want to be everything at once.<br>
Teenage years brought intense passions: for history, I wanted to be a historian; for music, a musician; for physics, I dreamed of NASA; for religion, I considered becoming a theologian or religious scholar; for sociology, geography, literature, and… biology. Eventually, I had to choose just two paths.</p>
<p>My choices were led by the desire to serve God and His creation through what challenged and fascinated me.<br>
First, I chose Medicine — because I love people and wanted to care for them.<br>
Second, I chose Biology Education — a unique union between Science and Teaching.<br>
I love life, the diversity of life, and the paradoxical harmony between its simplicity and complexity.</p>
<p>And what came of these choices? Here’s a summary of my short professional biography, copied and pasted from a recent conference where I was a speaker:</p>
<div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic;">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Emilyn holds a Biology degree from the Federal University of Pará (UFPA), with internships through CIEE and later through a scientific research project (PIBIC/CNPq) at the Molecular Biology Laboratory of the Bacteriology and Mycology Section at the Evandro Chagas Institute (SABMI/IEC), with which she maintains collaboration to this day. She earned a Master’s degree in Infectious Diseases from the State University of Pará (UEPA) and a PhD in Microbiology from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), with a ‘sandwich’ research period at Paris-Sud University, France, in collaboration with the Laboratory of Molecular Biology Applied to Mycobacteria (LABMAM) at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute – Fiocruz (IOC/Fiocruz).<br>
She worked as a research technologist at Fiotec, in the Bacteriology and Bioassays Laboratory of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (INI/Fiocruz), a regional reference in mycobacteria, where she gained experience in clinical research and molecular biology diagnostics for mycobacteria. She participated in the clinical projects Phoenix-NIH, TB-Alliance, and Report-Brazil.<br>
Since 2021, she has been a member of the TB Genomics and Tuberculosis Omics Research (TORCH) groups, mainly coordinating the SMARTT clinical research project as a postdoctoral fellow at Stellenbosch University, Cape Town, South Africa.<br>
Her current research focuses on personalized medicine through genomic sequencing of patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis.<br>
Her interests include public health, epidemiology, molecular biology, antimicrobial resistance, genomic surveillance, ‘omics’, bioinformatics, and science education.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<hr>
<div style="text-align: justify; font-style: normal;">
<p>To wrap up this introduction, a poetic reminder:<br>
Research work demands an incredible sense of urgency.<br>
Everything feels like it’s for “yesterday,” and we live buried under deadlines.<br>
Proactivity, creativity, and resilience are almost like components of our oxygen molecule.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s why I want to share my favorite poem here — as a reminder that, even in the rush of life, we shouldn’t forget to appreciate its tiny little wonders.</p>

<p>“Não gosto das palavras fatigadas de informar. Dou mais respeito às que vivem de barriga no chão.”<br>

<section id="oi-você-leitor" class="level2" style="text-align: justify">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="oi-você-leitor">Oi você, leitor!</h2>
<p>Deixando a minha relutância de lado sobre apresentar-me publicamente, vou começar essa jornada por basicamente três motivos:</p>
<p><strong>1. Primeiro</strong>, porque pode te auxiliar em algum momento na sua carreira profissional, seja pelos erros ou pelos acertos da minha trajetória;</p>
<p><strong>2. Segundo</strong>, porque talvez você queira participar de um dos grupos de estudos que coordeno aos finais de semana, em Português ou Inglês (mais detalhes aqui);</p>
<p><strong>3. Finalmente</strong>, porque talvez possamos criar ou participar de uma nova iniciativa legal para a sociedade. Olha que interessante!</p>
<p>Bem, vamos lá às devidas apresentações na área profissional, afinal, não somos definidos por diplomas, tudo isso é apenas uma parte importante da vida, mas não “A mais importante” … Me chamo Emilyn Costa Conceição Sharma, sou natural da cidade de Belém, estado do Pará, Brasil. Apesar das dificuldades enfrentadas pela minha família e educadores para que “pegasse o gosto” de estudar durante a infância, acho que a persistência deles deu certo, e cá estou.</p>
<p>Depois de uma jornada não tão convencional, me apaixonei pelo conhecimento e ele passou a ser como um chocolate mágico: eu queria comer e comer, mas percebia que ele nunca acabava e sempre tinha mais para aproveitar. Como não tinha acesso à internet, celular ou até mesmo à televisão naquela época, toda a minha fonte de conhecimento vinha do espaço de educação formal (a escola) e informal (da biblioteca da minha vó, que era professora). Foram várias escolas, locais onde vivenciei bullyings, traumas, recomeços e, mais tarde, um oásis de equilíbrio emocional, intelectual, social e de proteção.</p>
<p>Esse contexto me fez querer ser tudo ao mesmo tempo. A adolescência trouxe paixões avassaladoras: pela história, quis ser historiadora; pela música, quis ser musicista; pela física, sonhei com a NASA; pela religião, considerei ser teóloga ou cientista da religião; pela sociologia, geografia, literatura e… biologia. Então, tive que escolher apenas duas opções.</p>
<p>As minhas escolham foram pelo desejo de servir a Deus e a Sua criação com aquilo que me desafiava e encantava. A primeira escolha fora a Medicina, por amar as pessoas e querer cuidar delas, e a segunda, Biologia – na modalidade licenciatura –, união singular entre Ciência e da Educação. Amo a vida, amo a diversidade da vida e a paradoxal harmonia entre a simplicidade e a complexidade que ela carrega. E qual foi o resultado dessas escolhas? Bem, aqui vai um resumo da minha curta biografia profissional, enviado ao congresso onde fui palestrante recente (foi copia e cola mesmo):</p>
<div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic;">

<p>“Emilyn é bióloga formada pela Universidade Federal do Pará (UFPA), com estágio pelo CIEE e, posteriormente, em um projeto de iniciação científica (PIBIC/CNPq) no Laboratório de Biologia Molecular da Seção de Bacteriologia e Micologia do Instituto Evandro Chagas (SABMI/IEC), com o qual mantém colaboração até o momento.

<p>Para finalizar essa apresentação, um lembrete poético. Gostaria de dizer que a área de pesquisa é de uma urgência imensa. Tudo é “para ontem” e vivemos imersos em prazos. A proatividade, a criatividade e a resiliência quase fazem parte da nossa molécula de oxigênio. Talvez por isso vou deixar aqui o meu poema favorito, para lembrar que, na correria da vida, não podemos deixar de apreciar as coisas miudinhas dela.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Uso a palavra para compor meus silêncios.<br>
Não gosto das palavras fatigadas de informar.<br>
Dou mais respeito às que vivem de barriga no chão — tipo água, pedra, sapo.<br>
Entendo bem o sotaque das águas.<br>
Dou respeito às coisas desimportantes e aos seres desimportantes.<br>
Prezo insetos mais que aviões.<br>
Prezo a velocidade das tartarugas mais que a dos mísseis.<br>
Tenho em mim um atraso de nascença.<br>
Eu fui aparelhado para gostar de passarinhos.<br>
Tenho abundância de ser feliz por isso.<br>
Meu quintal é maior do que o mundo.<br>
Sou um apanhador de desperdícios:<br>
Amo os restos como as boas moscas.<br>
Queria que a minha voz tivesse um formato de canto.<br>
Porque eu não sou da informática: eu sou da invencionática.<br>
Só uso a palavra para compor meus silêncios.</p>
